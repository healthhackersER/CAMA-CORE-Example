# Install
1. Clone Repository - [HowTo GIT](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow)  
    `git clone https://github.com/healthhackersER/CAMA-CORE-Example.git`
2. Run npm installer  
   `npm install`
1. Run Application - Runs [Expo](https://docs.expo.io/versions/v33.0.0/introduction/running-in-the-browser/) in Browser  
   `npm run web`

## Pre-requisities
- **Node.js**: In order to install Expo CLI you will need to have Node.js (we recommend the latest stable version- but the maintenance and active LTS releases will also work) installed on your computer. [Download the recommended version of Node.js.](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- **Git**: Additionally, you'll need Git to create new projects. [You can download Git from here.](https://git-scm.com/)

# Getting Started
1. [**React Native**](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)
   > _React Native_ is like _React_, but it uses native components instead of web components as building blocks. 
So to understand the basic structure of a React Native app, you need to understand some of the basic React concepts, like [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html), components, ``state``, and ``props``.   
   [To learn more about this you can find a tutorial here.](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/tutorial)
2. [**Expo**](https://expo.io/) 
   > There's no need to install anything or even understand everything here, 
this page is meant to give you an overview of some of the big pieces of building a managed app. 
In the same way that getting a quick tour of Paris won't make you an expert on Paris, 
this walkthrough serves to help you identify a few landmarks and the most important areas in the managed workflow. 
You can do a walkthrough of the bare workflow later on.
   [To learn more about this you can find the walkthrough here.](https://docs.expo.io/versions/v36.0.0/introduction/walkthrough/)
3. [**TypeScript**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
   > [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is a language which extends JavaScript by adding type definitions.  
   > [Here you can find a documentation how to develop with TypeScript and React-Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/typescript)   
3. [**GitFlow - Branching Model**](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow)
    > Gitflow Workflow is a Git workflow design that was first published and made popular by Vincent Driessen at nvie. The Gitflow Workflow defines a strict branching model designed around the project release. This provides a robust framework for managing larger projects.  
    
    > The core idea behind the [**Feature Branch Workflow**](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow) is that all feature development should take place in a dedicated branch instead of the master branch. This encapsulation makes it easy for multiple developers to work on a particular feature without disturbing the main codebase. It also means the master branch will never contain broken code, which is a huge advantage for continuous integration environments.
